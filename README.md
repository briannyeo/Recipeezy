# Recipeezy
Recipeezy is an app that is created with the Create-React-App. It utilizes an API by Edmamam (https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api) to search for recipes.  

## Description
Recipeezy  aims to simplify the process of preparing food at home, be it whether or not you're meal prepping for the entire week for just for a simple dinner with with friends! Search for what you'd like to prepare (E.g. Chicken / Fish / Beans) and be inspired with a whole list of unique recipes to choose from. 

Upon adding your favourite recipes to your "Planned Meals" page, a grocery list will automatically be generated based on the ingredients you need to buy for the meals you've planned. 

It's that simple! Grocery shopping will never be easier! 

## Technology Used
This project utilizes React, React Router 6, Axios (for the API call) and React Bootstrap for components like the recipe cards, navbar and searchbar.

## User Stories
As someone who prioritizes eating healthy, home cooking is a great way to have full control over the food I eat and it also helps save some money in the process. However, I've always found meal planning to be incredibly frustrating as I would always need to manually note down a long list of ingredients I need to buy. 

Hence, I decided to work on an app that allows me to plan a week's worth of meals and have all the required ingredients I need compiled into a a easy and convenient grocery list.

Each recipe card also contains important nutritional information such as calories, protein, carbohydrates and fats to allow me to pick the right meals that suits my dietary needs. 

## Future Updates
Currently the grocery list does not compile common ingredients among different recipes. For example, it does not list 3 tablespoons of salt if "Grilled Chicken Breast" requires 1 tablespoon and "Fish and Chips" requires 2 tablespoon. Additionally, a feature could be implemented to automatically convert different measurements of the same ingredients to simplify the grocery shopping experience. 

Could also implement a feature in future updates to sort the recipes according to dietary requirements such as food allergies or vegetarian options etc.
